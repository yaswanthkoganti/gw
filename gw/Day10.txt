Message Triggering:
-EventAwareEntity,MessageContext,Message
	|		|	    |
  entity having     virtual entity  it is an entity contains the payload that needs to be sent to external system.
events field is	     used for 			(messagename,payload,eventname)
event aware	     generating
(added,Removed,updated payload
ootb events available)
-To add an event(custom) we use entity.addEvent("customEventName")
-To identify the destination we use destination Id(unique from 0-63 only we can use).
-transportplugin is mandatory field.
-alternate primary entity is used for safe ordering.
-event fired rules:
	-Event fired rules execute child if parent is true only else child willnot be triggered.
	-datachanges in event fired rules it donot trigger preupdate or validtion.
	- avoid data changes for the outside fired ruleset.

Message Payload:
-Data generated in event fired rules that is to be passed to external system.
-when we want to send the data which contains late binding value(dynamic value ex:timestamp of message received) we use the template and request plugin is used
<@@ @@>
-gosu template is as of now we are not using.
-xml model is a gx model in guidewire
-to create a gx model we need to select the entity.
-xml model fields have key property and normal property.
-We use this gx model is used to create payload
var xml=fullyqualifiednameofgx.entitytype
if we use xml.asUTFString() in create message it will create the payload.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Messaging:
-request used for latebinding
-transport-sends the message to external system
-reply-used for acknowledgement
-In request plugin we can pass senderRefId which is stored at message table.
-request plugin contains beforesend()(used for late binding)
-If message failed to reach external source the retry takes place based on
	-maxretry field in message table
	-manually retry.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Batch process:
-Batch process are background tasks.
-4 types of batch processes
	-schedulable:Based on timer
	-API runnable:through an external web service 
	-Maintanence:Used 
	-UIRunnable
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conversion:

-Migrate data from legacy to guidewire application.
-two types of appropach
	-bigbang
	-renewal
-Flatfiles are converted to pc data using informatica,etc.. by intermediate representation etl(extract transform load)
source(flat files)->source staging(cleaning activities)->Target Staging(many activites to match the data with PC system)->policy migration
-bigbang approach we perform transfer of data.
