Gosu:
	var _varname:datatype as varname
-to create a package we have to craete inside
	config/gsrc/companyname/domain/classes/class name
-
-encapsulation in gosu is done by enhancement
config developers use gosu classes static methods mostly.
integration developers use non static methods and static methods.
static methods are used for 
-validations and forms inference in policy center
-Dynamic assignment and SIU lifecycle in billing center


To create a class
-We create a new package
-create class
-define properties and methods
-deploy package and class
-refer the class

class name should be in pascal case
method names should be in camel case


Gosu enhancement:
-gosu enhancement is code that enhances the func of existing entity.
-enhancement file extension is .gsx
-gosu enhancements can be written for entities or for java class
-configuration developers mostly deal with enhancement.
package structure is same as gosu classes but stored in enhancements and inside it based on the enhancement type(java class or entity) the sub folder is choosen.
-Enhancements for entities have setters,getters and methods
-getter and setter will not store the value into the database.
Syntax:
-------
enhancement  EnhancementName:entity.EntityName{
property get Propertyname():return type{
//to access the properties of the object we use this.
//logic
return value
}
}
property set Propertyname(var varname:type){
//to access the properties of the object we use this.
//logic
}
}

function functionName()
{
}
to get the value we use referencename.property
to set value we assign value to the referancename.property=value

debug is used to verify where we commit mistake while coding using breakpoints,watchersetc..
to view all the breakpoints the shortcut is ctrl+shft+f8
alt+shft+f9-debug server.

Script Parameter:
-It acts like a global variable.
-They are used in
BC:delinquency
pc:rating
-configuration developers define script parameters
-can be referenced anywhere as read only values in gosu code
-scriptparameter can be defined in ScriptParameters.xml
-Ex:
 <ScriptParameterPack ParamName="RecordInHistory_UserViewsOfContacts" ParamType="bit">
      <ParamValue>true</ParamValue>
if we alter existing then alt+shft+l if we create new one we have to restart the server.
refer scriptparameter in code
ScriptParameter.parametername


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
EntityNames:
-Entity names are used to customize the fields of entity(ex:first name and last name can be displayed as displayname.
-entity name has the extension .en
-entity names has name,entitypath,sortpath,sortorder
-datetime by default without concatenation gives longdate format
-datetime when concatenated with a string gives in shortdate format
-for typekey in return statement we get the typecode directly if we not specify.displayName in return statement
-If an entity has no entityname and you want to use it then it displays all the details of entity.
-we can specify custom names which is used to get the values in different ways.
-we can call it using obj.getDisplayName(type) type-is the type given for custom name
-if we use the foreign key relation then we must tick the use entity feild.Else it will not return the corresponding display name.it will return the object.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependent Dropdown:
-one drop down dependent on the other drop down.
-they relate typecodes with other type codes.
-In child we add category for the parent typecode to make dependent.
-both parent and child should be 
-one type key has only one keyfilters.
-keyfilter is used to relate the parent and child.
