PCF:
Atomic widgets
-to get data from database(populate from database) we use variables which can bind to entities or virtual properties.
-each atomic widget can be bound to only one field.
-In properties if we create property it should start with capital
-the id field in property should start with small letter and it should be unique.
-value attribute is used to specify the value of the atomic widget.the atomic widget will automatically accessible in both edit and view modes



Data        			InputWidgets        cell widgets
varcahr,integer,decimal 	Text Input		Text cell
varcahr,shorttext,longtext	Text area		Text area cell
,mediumtext,text
date,date time			date input		datecell
money				monetary amount input	monetary amount cell
bit				Boolean dropdown input	checkbox cell,radio button cell
				boolean radio button "
				checkbox input
array				range input		range cell
				range radio button "	range radio button cell

typekey				typekey I/P
				typekey radio button i/p  typekeycell
 			


-Supertype as subtype.field  -- cast the object to subtype
-label is used to give name to the widget.
-one way by giving the values directly in "" of label value property
-other way is by assigning the value in displayKeys.property file and referring them where we require.
-to display the data dynamically then we need to specify them using({0},{1}) it shows the label accepts 2 dynamic parameters
-the values for the parameter is given in label properties value.
-the values for the properties can be dynamic but based on datatype of the property except for Id.


Detail view:
-input columns can be used for alignment
-layout widgets can be used to provide the contents effectively
-to include the detail view in the screen we should create a panel ref in the page where we want to include pcf
-panel ref is used to refer other views in screen
-panel ref contains def property. which is used to refer the view. we need to pass the root object of the view from the def property.



Editable detail view:
if the parent is editable then only the child views can be editable
default value of list detail view and card view is false and for others it is true.

-to place edit buttons in the screen.screen must contain toolbar.

--------------------------------------
Input Set:
-To add inputset into the pcf then the pcf file must contain Input column.It will automatically creates input column if it doesnot exists.
-Input sets created as separate pcf file can be reused using the inputsetref in different pcfs.
-Input sets can be classified as shared logic and reusable input sets.
-if we create a reusable pcf then the root object(required variable) must be specified.
-if we use inline(shared logic i/pset) then the root object of parent can be used by the inline pcf.




List view:

-list view is displayed using row iterator.
-row widgets defines collection of columns to be iterated.
-cell widget is individual column in row.
-list view also takes the root object(required variable).
-row iterator is also a widget it processes and generates the row widgets and cell widgets.
-row iterator has three main properties value,editable and element name.
-we have to define properties for rowiterator and for cells.
Toolbar is must in listview


Editable List view:
-Iterator buttons are used to add,remove or modify the cells
-list view panel contains iterator buttons
-edit buttons are placed at screen level
-checkbox can be hidden using hidecheckboxifreadonly.
-location: startineditmode
alwaysineditmode

iterator buttons:
-add iterator button
-link iterator buttons to row iterator
		-right click on iterator button
		-linkiterator
		-select the iterator 
-toadd and toremove property
-hidecheckbox if readonly
